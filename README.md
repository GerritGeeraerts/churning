## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where we set up a machine learning infrastructure on Azure using Terraform and MLflow. This project focuses on creating a scalable and efficient environment for data storage, model training, and model deployment. We use Terraform to provision resources in Azure Cloud, such as Azure Data Lake for storing raw data and an Azure Virtual Machine for hosting the MLflow Server. Our training scripts initially run locally but will be deployed to Azure ML for enhanced performance and resource utilization.

```

## 🚀 Setting Up Infrastructure and Running the Training Script

### Step 1: Install Terraform
You can follow the instructions from the [official Terraform website](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) to install Terraform on your machine.

### Step 2: Provision Azure Resources with Terraform
Navigate to the `terraform` directory and run the following commands:
```bash
terraform init   # Initialize Terraform
terraform apply  # Apply the Terraform plan to set up resources
```

Ensure that you have configured your Azure CLI and have the necessary credentials in place.

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
#### For Linux
Add the environment variables to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) and source it:
```bash
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=**your_azure_storage_account**
export AZURE_STORAGE_KEY=**your_azure_storage_key**
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=**your_mlflow_server_uri**
```
#### For Windows
Add the environment variables through the system environment variables settings.

### Step 5: Run the Training Script
Navigate to the `scripts` directory and run:
```bash
python train_model.py
```
> Note: The current implementation downloads the data from Azure Data Lake, trains the model locally, and logs the results to the MLflow server.

### Optional: Deploy Training to Azure ML
Future updates will include deployment of the training script to Azure Machine Learning for better resource utilization and faster training times.

## ⚡ Benefits and Use Cases
- **Scalability:** Seamlessly scale up or down with Azure resources.
- **Efficiency:** Faster model training with cloud-based compute resources.
- **Reproducibility:** MLflow provides easy tracking of experiments and results.

## 🚫 Disclaimer
Please ensure you comply with your organization's cloud resource usage policies and manage your Azure resources responsibly to avoid unexpected charges.

## 📌 Personal Situation
This project emerged from my keen interest in cloud-based machine learning solutions. The transition from local setup to cloud-based infrastructure was eye-opening and significantly enhanced my understanding of scalable ML solutions.
